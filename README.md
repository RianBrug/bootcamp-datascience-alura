# Some considerations:

### In this repository you will find all my notebooks from differentes modules of Alura's 2020 Datascience bootcamp course.

### In best cases, I should be finishing it around march/2021. 

### All the data that you can find here were taken from TabNet DataSUS open data system (LINK: https://datasus.saude.gov.br/ )

### I'm doing my best to bring information in a claire way, although I'm just at the beggining of my walk into data science, you can check my considerations and conclusions right after everything that are plooted (or previously in some cases :P)

### These machines reviewed by Alura's student orientation team, and suggested improvements will be properly documented and committed :)
